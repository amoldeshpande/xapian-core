 "Welcome to Mike's Mechanical Repairs."

  Mike McDonald is a mechanic who enjoys repairing things of a mechanical sort.  That's what he does.

From autos to zip-lines, from tea-lights to x-rays,
from sea ships to u-boats - Mike can fix them all.

How much o'brien do we have?  Miles O'Brien, that's how much.

And that "joke" again in Unicode:
How much o’brien do we have?  Miles O’Brien, that’s how much.

He determined the last will and testament will be read next week.
The exact time of the reading of the will will be determined soon.

We do have we do we have do we.
